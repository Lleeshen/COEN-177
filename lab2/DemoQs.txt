How many queues are there?

According to proc.h, there are 15 priority queues. In the explanation for NR_SCHED_QUEUES being 16, it says the number has to be the lowest priority + 1.

What queue is highest and lowest priority?

As I saw from reading proc.h as referenced in the previous question, Queue 15 is the lowest priority. Also, since the queues 0 - 6 cannot be changed without the system crashing, I can reasonably assume that queue 0 has the most priority.

What C expression gives first ready process in queue

For a queue q, rdy_head[q] is the first ready process if it exists.

What happens if that queue does not have a process

If the queue does not have a process, nothing happens, and the next queue is checked. Usually the next queue is a queue of lower priority, but with my modifications, a random queue is checked.

Behavior of changes

Queues affected

Every non-essential queue, i.e Queues 7 through 15, are affected.

Probability that randomization take place

There is about 1/10 chance that the priority of the queue is changed.

Parameter being randomized

The priority queue that is used to choose the process is altered so there is a chance of a process in a lower priority queue is picked.

Difference between original system and modified system

The modified system runs slightly slower since processes not essential to the OS are randomized in the priority, causing priority inversion for some processes.
